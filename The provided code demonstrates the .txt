The provided code demonstrates the use of class inheritance in a Java financial calculator. Here's a concise explanation of the code's structure and the inheritance concept:

Class Inheritance in a Java Financial Calculator:

Parent Class (Main):

The code features a parent class called Main. This parent class serves as the foundation for the financial calculator and contains attributes and methods common to all financial calculations.
Child Classes (SimpleInterestCalculator, CompoundInterestCalculator, and EMICalculator):

Inheritance is employed to create child classes specializing in distinct financial calculations.
There are three child classes: SimpleInterestCalculator, CompoundInterestCalculator, and EMICalculator.
Each child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class (Main) while adding or modifying functionality to perform specific financial calculations.
Functionality:

Users are presented with the option to choose between different financial calculations: Simple Interest, Compound Interest, or EMI.
Depending on the user's choice, the program utilizes the appropriate child class to execute the selected calculation. This demonstrates the flexibility and extensibility of class inheritance, as new financial calculation types could be added as additional child classes without altering the common functionality in the parent class.
In essence, this code leverages class inheritance to organize financial calculations efficiently. The parent class consolidates shared attributes and methods, while the child classes inherit this functionality and adapt it for specialized calculations. Users benefit from a user-friendly interface that enables them to choose the specific financial calculation they require.

Cache memory: The cache is a smaller, faster memory which stores copies of the data
from the most frequently used main memory locations. As long as most memory
accesses are cached memory locations, the average latency of memory accesses will be
closer to the cache latency than to the latency of main memory.
2. Hit Ratio: You want to increase as much as possible the likelihood of the cache
containing the memory addresses that the processor wants. Hit Ratio= No. of hits/
(No. of hits + No. of misses)
There are only fewer cache lines than the main memory blocks, an algorithm is needed
for mapping main memory blocks into cache lines. Further a means is needed for
determining which main memory block currently occupies in a cache line. The choice
of cache function dictates how the cache is organized. Three techniques can be used.
1. Direct mapping.
2. Associative mapping.
3. Set Associative mapping.

Direct Mapped Cache: The direct mapped cache is the simplest form of cache and the
easiest to check for a hit. Since there is only one possible place that any memory
location can be cached, there is nothing to search; the line either contains the memory


information we are looking for, or it doesn&#39;t. Unfortunately, the direct mapped cache
also has the worst performance, because again there is only one place that any address
can be stored. Let&#39;s look again at our 512 KB level 2 cache and 64 MB of system
memory. As you recall this cache has 16,384 lines (assuming 32-byte cache lines) and
so each one is shared by 4,096 memory addresses. In the absolute worst case, imagine
that the processor needs 2 different addresses (call them X and Y) that both map to the
same cache line, in alternating sequence (X, Y, X, Y). This could happen in a small
loop if you were unlucky. The processor will load X from memory and store it in cache.
Then it will look in the cache for Y, but Y uses the same cache line as X, so it won&#39;t be
there. So Y is loaded from memory, and stored in the cache for future use. But then the
processor requests X, and looks in the cache only to find Y. This conflict repeats over
and over. The net result is that the hit ratio here is 0%. This is a worst case scenario,
but in general the performance is worst for this type of mapping.


Fully Associative Cache: The fully associative cache has the best hit ratio because any
line in the cache can hold any address that needs to be cached. This means the problem
seen in the direct mapped cache disappears, because there is no dedicated single line
that an address must use. However (you knew it was coming), this cache suffers from
problems involving searching the cache. If a given address can be stored in any of
16,384 lines, how do you know where it is? Even with specialized hardware to do the
searching, a performance penalty is incurred. And this penalty occurs for all accesses
to memory, whether a cache hit occurs or not, because it is part of searching the cache
to determine a hit. In addition, more logic must be added to determine which of the
various lines to use when a new entry must be added (usually some form of a &quot;least
recently used&quot; algorithm is employed to decide which cache line to use next). All this
overhead adds cost, complexity and execution time.
Set Associative Cache
Set-associative cache is a specific type of cache memory that occurs in RAM and
processors. It divides the cache into between two to eight different sets or areas. Data
is stored in them all, but the cache distributes it to each set-in sequence, rather than
randomly. In a set associative cache, there are a fixed number of locations (called a set)


that a given address may be stored in. The number of locations in each set is the
associative of the cache. Since a set associative cache has more sets and areas mean
more performance, but also higher cost when it comes to manufacturing and
implementing that memory.



SCSI bus:
DEFINITION:
The Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a set of parallel interface standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for attaching printers, disk drives, scanners and other peripherals to computers. SCSI is supported by all major operating systems.
ARCHITECTURE:
 
 
FEATURES:
•	New types of peripheral devices can be added to a system without hardware changes; only a new I/O device driver is needed
•	SCSI satisfies the high-performance requirements of medium and large systems
•	Intelligence can be moved from the host to a peripheral device, thereby off-loading the system or controller's processor
•	SCSI's ability to logically disconnect and reconnect devices from the bus means that slow operations can be performed offline, thus allowing several operations in a system to run concurrently

Cache mapping is a crucial concept in computer architecture that determines how data is stored and retrieved in a cache memory. Three common cache mapping techniques are direct-mapped cache, set-associative cache, and fully-associative cache.


Direct-Mapped Cache:

Mapping: Each block of main memory maps to exactly one cache line.
Associativity: Cache is divided into sets, each containing one line.
Advantages:
Simplicity in implementation.
Lower hardware complexity.
Reduced power consumption.
Disadvantages:
Higher chance of cache conflicts.
Limited flexibility in mapping.
Set-Associative Cache:

Mapping: Each block of main memory can map to a set of cache lines.
Associativity: Cache is divided into multiple sets, each containing multiple lines.
Advantages:
Offers a balance between complexity and flexibility.
Reduces the chance of cache conflicts compared to direct-mapped cache.
Disadvantages:
Higher hardware complexity than direct-mapped caches.
Increased power consumption compared to direct-mapped caches.
Fully-Associative Cache:

Mapping: Each block of main memory can map to any cache line.
Associativity: Cache consists of a single set containing all lines.
Advantages:
Maximum flexibility in mapping.
Minimizes cache conflicts.
Disadvantages:
Highest hardware complexity.
Increased power consumption.
Common Terms:

Cache Line: The smallest unit of data that can be stored in the cache.
Cache Set: A group of cache lines in set-associative and fully-associative caches.
Cache Index: Part of the address used to identify the set in set-associative and fully-associative caches.
Cache Tag: Part of the address used to identify which block is stored in a cache line.
Cache Hit: Occurs when the requested data is found in the cache.
Cache Miss: Occurs when the requested data is not found in the cache, requiring a fetch from the main memory.
Performance Considerations:

Hit Rate: Percentage of memory accesses that result in cache hits.
Miss Rate: Percentage of memory accesses that result in cache misses.
Hit Time: Time taken to access data from the cache on a hit.
Miss Penalty: Additional time taken when there is a cache miss.



LRU (Least Recently Used) Page Replacement Algorithm:

Overview:

LRU is a page replacement algorithm that selects the page for replacement that has not been used for the longest period of time.
It aims to keep frequently used pages in memory to minimize page faults.
Implementation:

Maintain Page Access Order:

Keep track of the order in which pages are accessed. This can be done using a data structure like a stack, linked list, or a counter associated with each page.
Update Page Access Information:

When a page is accessed, move it to the front of the access order data structure (or update its access timestamp/count).
Page Replacement:

When a page fault occurs and there is no free space in memory, select the page at the end of the access order data structure (least recently used) for replacement.


Advantages:

Takes into account the actual usage patterns of pages.
Effective in scenarios where certain pages are accessed more frequently than others.
Disadvantages:

Implementation complexity: Requires maintaining additional data structures to track page access order.
Overhead: Keeping track of every page access can add overhead to the system.


Standard: IEEE-754 is a widely adopted standard for representing floating-point numbers in binary on modern computer systems.
Components:

Sign Bit (S):

1 bit that represents the sign of the number (0 for positive, 1 for negative).
Exponent (E):

An 8-bit exponent that represents the power of 2 by which the fraction is to be multiplied.
It uses a biased representation to allow for both positive and negative exponents.
Fraction (F):

A 23-bit fraction (also known as the significand or mantissa) that represents the actual binary digits of the floating-point number.


Advantages:

Simplifies hardware implementation compared to restoring division.
Suitable for pipelined processing in hardware.
Disadvantages:

Requires more iterations than restoring division in some cases.
Slower for small divisors.
Note:
Non-Restoring Division is often used in hardware implementations where simplicity and pipeline-friendly designs are essential. Understanding its steps and logic is crucial for efficient division in computer architectures.
